# Contributing to SealKeeper

Thank you for considering a contribution to SealKeeper. The project welcomes contributions of all kinds — bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, code patches, security audits, translations.

Please take a moment to read this guide before opening an issue or pull request. Following these conventions makes review faster and increases the chance your contribution is merged smoothly.

## Code of Conduct

By participating, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In short: be respectful, be patient, assume good faith, and remember that everyone is volunteering their time.

## Filing Issues

Before opening a new issue, please:

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/sched75/sealkeeper/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. For bugs: use the **Bug report** template and include enough information to reproduce
3. For features: use the **Feature request** template and explain the user need clearly
4. For security: **do not file a public issue** — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)

## Submitting Pull Requests

### Before you start

- For non-trivial changes, please open an issue first to discuss the approach. This avoids wasted work if the change is not aligned with project direction.
- For typo fixes and documentation improvements, you can submit a PR directly.

### Pull request workflow

    actor C as Contributor
    participant F as Fork
    participant U as Upstream (sched75/sealkeeper)
    participant CI as GitHub Actions
    participant M as Maintainer

    C->>F: 1. Fork the repository
    C->>F: 2. Create branch (feat/..., fix/..., docs/...)
    C->>F: 3. Commit with sign-off (-s)<br/>following Conventional Commits
    C->>F: 4. Push branch to fork
    C->>U: 5. Open Pull Request to main
    U->>CI: 6. Trigger CI (lint, test, build)
    CI-->>U: 7. Status check (pass/fail)
    U->>M: 8. Request review
    M-->>C: 9. Review comments
    C->>F: 10. Address feedback, push again
    M->>U: 11. Approve and merge
    Note over U: Squash-merge to main<br/>Branch deleted from fork
```

### Pull request checklist

- [ ] Branch from `main`, with a descriptive name like `feat/add-policy-validation` or `fix/redis-reconnect`
- [ ] Each commit is signed-off (`git commit --sign-off`) — see DCO section below
- [ ] Each commit message follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
- [ ] New code is covered by tests (Go) where applicable
- [ ] `make lint` passes locally
- [ ] `make test` passes locally
- [ ] If the change affects user-facing behaviour, documentation is updated
- [ ] If the change affects security properties, a note is added in the PR description
- [ ] The PR description explains the motivation and links the related issue

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

SealKeeper is licensed under AGPL v3, which requires us to track the provenance of contributions. We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) for this. Each commit must include a sign-off line:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

You can add this automatically with `git commit -s` or `git commit --sign-off`. By signing off, you certify that you have the right to submit the contribution under the project license.

### Commit message convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

<optional longer description>

<optional footer (e.g. BREAKING CHANGE, Refs #123)>

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `security`.

Examples:

```
feat(policy): add Diceware passphrase generation mode

fix(store): handle Redis reconnection on transient errors

docs(readme): clarify zero-knowledge guarantees

security(crypto): replace deprecated GCM implementation
```

## Development Setup

### Coding standards

- Run `gofmt -s` on all Go code before committing
- Run `golangci-lint run` and fix all reported issues
- Add the AGPL header (see `LICENSE-HEADER.txt`) at the top of every new Go file
- Add the SPDX identifier `// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later` as the first line of every Go file
- Write tests for new functionality (target ≥ 80% coverage on `internal/`)
- Keep functions small (≤ 50 lines) and packages cohesive
- Prefer explicit over clever — security code should be boring

## Reporting Security Issues

Please **never** report security vulnerabilities in a public issue. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the responsible disclosure process.

## Recognition

All contributors are listed in the [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file (created on first non-maintainer contribution) and credited in the release notes for the versions they contributed to.

## Questions?

If anything in this guide is unclear, please open an issue with the `question` label or start a [discussion](https://github.com/sched75/sealkeeper/discussions).
