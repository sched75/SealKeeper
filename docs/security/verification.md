# Verifying SealKeeper release artifacts

> This page is the canonical reference for verifying everything we publish:

## TL;DR — verify everything

```bash
TAG=v0.1.0   # ← the release you downloaded

# 1. GPG-signed checksums for the binaries
gpg --import path/to/sealkeeper-maintainer.asc
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS

# 2. Cosign keyless signature on the OCI image
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/sched75/SealKeeper/.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/sealkeeper/sealkeeper:${TAG}

# 3. SLSA provenance attestation
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/sealkeeper/sealkeeper:${TAG} \
  --repo sched75/SealKeeper

# 4. SBOM (CycloneDX 1.5) for the image
cosign download attestation \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.5 \
  ghcr.io/sealkeeper/sealkeeper:${TAG} > image.sbom.intoto.jsonl
```

If every command exits with status 0 and no warning, the release is intact and
provably came from this project's `release.yml` workflow.

## 1. Verify binaries (GPG)

Each release attaches `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.asc`. The `.asc` is a
detached, ASCII-armored GPG signature produced by the **maintainer key**
documented in `SECURITY.md` (full fingerprint there). The signing key is
**never** the same as the cosign keyless identity — cosign signs the image,
GPG signs the binary checksum file.

1. Download both files from the GitHub Release page along with the binary you
   actually want (`sealkeeper-linux-amd64`, etc.).
2. Import the maintainer public key (`SECURITY.md` includes the fingerprint and
   the keyserver of record). Verify the imported fingerprint matches.
3. Verify the signature:
   ```bash
   gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
   ```
   Expected: `Good signature from "SealKeeper Maintainers <…>" [ultimate]`.
4. Verify the binary against the signed checksums:
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
   ```
   Expected: every line ends with `OK`.

If the signature is `BAD` or the key fingerprint differs from the one pinned
in `SECURITY.md`, **do not run the binary**.

---

## 2. Verify the OCI image (cosign keyless)

Images are signed with cosign in keyless mode (Sigstore) — no static key, the
signature attests *the workflow that produced it*. Verification therefore
checks that the signing identity matches our GitHub Actions workflow.

Install cosign ≥ v2.4 (`brew install cosign` or
[releases](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases)).

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/sched75/SealKeeper/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/sealkeeper/sealkeeper:v0.1.0
```

Expected: `Verification for ghcr.io/sealkeeper/sealkeeper:v0.1.0 — The
following checks were performed: …`. Key fields to eyeball:

- `Issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- `Subject: https://github.com/sched75/SealKeeper/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`

The signature is also recorded in the public Rekor transparency log; cosign
checks Rekor inclusion automatically.

---

## 3. Verify SLSA build provenance

The release workflow uses `actions/attest-build-provenance@v2` to attach a
SLSA Level 2 provenance attestation to the image. The GitHub CLI can verify
it natively:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/sealkeeper/sealkeeper:v0.1.0 \
  --repo sched75/SealKeeper
```

Expected: `Loaded ... attestation(s) from ...; verified signed by ...; the
following predicate types were found: https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1`.

The predicate names the exact workflow run that built the image, so a
tampered image (different workflow, different commit, different runner) will
fail verification.

---

## 4. Inspect the SBOM (CycloneDX 1.5)

SBOMs are produced by `syft` (FR-L.66) and attached two ways:

- As a release asset (`sbom-image.cdx.json` and `sbom/sealkeeper-*.cdx.json`
  per binary) — convenient for offline review.
- As a cosign attestation on the image — verifiable end-to-end:

  ```bash
  cosign download attestation \
    --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.5 \
    ghcr.io/sealkeeper/sealkeeper:v0.1.0 \
    | jq -r '.payload | @base64d | fromjson | .predicate' \
    > image.sbom.cdx.json

  # Sanity check
  jq -e '.specVersion == "1.5"' image.sbom.cdx.json
  ```

Feed the resulting `image.sbom.cdx.json` into your supply-chain tooling
(Dependency-Track, Grype, etc.) to keep tabs on advisories that affect this
specific build.

---

## 5. What to do on a mismatch

Treat any verification failure as a potential supply-chain compromise:

1. Stop deploying or running the affected artifact.
2. Capture the exact commands and output you used.
3. File a private report following `SECURITY.md` (do **not** open a public
   issue first — this prevents an attacker from observing your discovery).
4. Re-check from a different network and machine, and against the canonical
   fingerprints published on the project website.
